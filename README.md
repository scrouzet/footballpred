## Basic score prediction
The 1st ideal dataset would be :
- score
- team playing
- minute of every goal (because the evolution of the score is a big constraint, I guess one is more likely to score when chasing than when leading)


## Go to the player level
- get the team playing for each game would allow to get the impact of each player. Then, based on the team supposed to play, one would be able to get a probability of score based on the association on specific players
